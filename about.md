# About

I currently live in Singapore and study at Yale-NUS College (computer science and global affairs). I have previously lived in Wuhan, China and the United States.

I am broadly interested in the tech world, contentious politics, and Chinese society. Unfortunately, the recursion joke does not belong to me.

You can also find me on
