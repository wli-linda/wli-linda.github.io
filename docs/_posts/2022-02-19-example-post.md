This is the first paragraph excerpt. 
Can it be multiple lines? I assume not. \\
Is this even a separate line in `.md`? Maybe not.

# Example post

Trying out Jekyll.

## Different formats

For example:
1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3

### Subheading

Text formatting like **bold** and *italics*?

## Tables
Omg... you need to be one line away from the _markdown heading_ for the tables to work... not that you need one line between the table header and the rows... Why am I like this...

| Testing | Attempt |
|---|:---:|
|pls|work|

I was honestly tempted to do this:
## Failed table
| Testing | Attempt |

|---|:---:|
| Testing | Attempt |
|pls|work|

Wow did I have no clue what was going on...

| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority |

| ambrosia <br>apples | gala | red delicious |
| pink lady | jazz | macintosh |
| honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |
